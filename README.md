# Grevillea_brachystylis_complex_analysis
Documentation for analyses of genomic data for Grevillea brachystylis (Proteaceae)

This repository contains the scripts used for running all genomic analyses in
Kestel et al. (2025) "Range-wide sampling and genomic analyses delimit entities within the morphologically challenging Grevillea brachystylis complex"

Scripts are located in the scripts folder.
Some additional files that reflect sample and parameter choices are included in the folder files

Demultiplexed data is available at the Sequence Read Archive under project PRJNA1213998.
